# Fibonacci Sequence Calculator

This Python script calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence and provides the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to that term.

## Features

- Computes the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to the specified term.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter the desired Fibonacci sequence term when prompted.

3. View the output, which includes the nth Fibonacci number and the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to that term.

## Example

### Input and Output

```bash
=======================================================
Enter a number                                  : 6
=======================================================
The 6th Fibonacci number is                     : 8
The sum of Fibonacci numbers up to 6 is         : 20
=======================================================
Do you want to restart the program? (y/n): n
Okay, I will exit now.
=======================================================
```

The script calculates the 6th term of the Fibonacci sequence (8) and the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to the 6th term (20).
