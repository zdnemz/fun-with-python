# FunWithPython - Math Game

Welcome to the "Math Game" project in the FunWithPython repository. This simple Python program allows you to practice your math skills by solving random arithmetic operations.

## About the Math Game

The "Math Game" is a command-line based interactive game where you are presented with a math operation to solve. You need to enter your answer, and the program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not.

## How to Play

1. Run the program by executing the `main.py` file.
2. Enter a math operation when prompted, following the example format (e.g., 2 + 3 * 5).
3. Enter your answer to the math operation.
4. The program will inform you if your answer is correct or provide the correct answer.

## Example

```bash
$ python main.py
'============MATH GAME============='
(example: 2 + 3 * 5)
Enter a math operation    : 4 * 6
=========================================
What is Your Answer       : 24
=========================================
Correct Answer!

=========================================
Do you want to play again? (y/n): y
Alright then.
'============MATH GAME============='
(example: 2 + 3 * 5)
Enter a math operation    : 8 / 2
=========================================
What is Your Answer       : 3
=========================================
Wrong Answer, the correct answer is 4

=========================================
Do you want to play again? (y/n): n
Okay, I will stop.
```
