# Prime Checker

This simple Python script checks whether a given number is a prime number or not.

## How the Program Works

- The script defines a function `prima(x)` to check if a number is prime.
- It then takes user input and uses the function to determine if the input number is prime.
- The script handles non-numeric input gracefully and prompts the user to enter a valid number.

## Notes

- Negative numbers are considered invalid, and the user is prompted to enter a valid number.
- The script continues to run in an infinite loop, allowing the user to check multiple numbers without restarting.
