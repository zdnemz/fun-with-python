# Palindrome Checker

A simple Python program to check if a given text is a palindrome.

## Description

This program takes a text input from the user and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the text you want to check.
3. The program will display whether the entered text is a palindrome or not.
4. You can choose to restart the program or exit.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

## Example

```
===========================================
|           PALINDROME CHECKER            |
===========================================
Input Text              : racecar
'racecar' is a palindrome
===========================================
Do you want to restart the program? (y/n) : y
Alright, let's restart.
===========================================
Input Text              : hello
'hello' is not a palindrome
===========================================
Do you want to restart the program? (y/n) : n
Okay, I will exit now.
===========================================
```
