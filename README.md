## Project Lists

1. [**Day Calculator**](src/day-calculator) : a simple day calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to input a specific date, and it calculates the difference between that date and the current date. The program then presents the result in terms of days passed or remaining.

2. [**Math Game**](src/math-game) :  a simple math game where users can input mathematical expressions, and the program evaluates and compares their answers with the correct result.
  
3. [**Password Checker**](src/password-checker) : a simple script that assesses the strength of a user-input password, classifying it as "Strong," "Medium," or "Weak" based on specified criteria. The criteria include the presence of symbols, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and a length between 8 and 16 characters.

4. [**Discount Calculator**](src/discount-calculator): a simple program that calculates the discount percentage between an original and discounted price. The user-friendly script prompts for input, validates numerical values, and provides results instantly.

5. [**Rock Paper Scissors**](src/rock-paper-scissors) : A simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Python. Test your luck against the computer and see if you can outsmart it!
